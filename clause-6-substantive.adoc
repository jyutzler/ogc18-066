== Description of Substantive Changes

=== Enforce alignment of SRS IDs between tables (2.1.5.1.2 and 2.2.6.1.2)
This change creates two new requirements, R146 and R147, that requires SRS IDs to be consistent between `gpkg_contents` and the two dependent tables, `gpkg_geometry_columns` and `gpkg_tile_matrix_set`. In previous versions, this was unspecified. This ambiguity creates a potential interoperability issue because client software could confuse the values if they are different. This change also includes an explanatory note in section 1.1.3.1.2 and new abstract tests in Annex A.
